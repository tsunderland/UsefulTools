# UsefulTools
This is a collection of tools that allow me to get work done.

## CreateIcon script
This script creates a Mac Iconset ICNS file for a given png file. The png file needs to be 1024x1024 pixels at the moment.

### Updates for this script:
- Automatically determine the pixel size of the original image.
- Better error handling

## Update SDK scirpt
This script updates the referenced MacOS sdk version number referenced by Qt and other related projects. This helps minimise issues with the updates breaking the build system. 

### Updates for this script: 
- Update references in a set of projects
- Request whether to preform backup prior to changing project makefiles. (they should all be in bitbucket or github anyway, but for those who don't like their sanity and sleep)

## MORE TO COME
I also maintain an extensive library of projects and tools used on a daily basis in Atlassian's BitBucket. Once I've ported the tooling or projects and removed any personal or sensitive information I'll upload more. Unfortunately every project seems to have confidentiality clauses at the moment, so I can't show you any of my existing projects but maybe I'll get around to finishing off some of the backburner projects and tools and post them here instead...
